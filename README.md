SMU BIA Datathon 2025




## Features

Our solution is centered around extracting the entity relationships from the unstructure text provided in the dataset. From these relationships, we were able to form the following graphs:

- Knowledge network graph üõú (with Neo4j)
- Geomap üó∫Ô∏è (with Leaflet.js)
- Timeline ‚è≥ (React component)

```

2. Navigate to the backend directory
```bash
  cd backend
```

3. Ensure you have the following environment variables in your backend folder:
```bash
  SUPABASE_URL=***

4. Install dependencies and run the backend server
```bash
  npm install
  npm run devStart
```

5. Navigate to the frontend directory
```bash
  cd my-nextjs-app
```

6. Ensure you have your backend endpoint as your environment variables:
```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000 
  (or whatever port your backend is running on)
```

7. Install dependencies and run the frontend server
```bash
